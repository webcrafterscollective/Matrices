## Matrices: An Introduction
### Definition and Notation
In mathematics, a matrix is a rectangular array of numbers, symbols, or expressions arranged in rows and columns. It is way to represent and manipulate linear relationships between different quantities.

### Structure of a Matrix
A matrix is typically denoted by a capital letter, such as $A$, and its elements are represented by $a_{ij}$, where $i$ represents the row number and $j$ represents the column number. For instance, in a $2 \times 3$ matrix:

$$
A = \begin{bmatrix}  
a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\
a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Here, $a_{11}$, $a_{12}$, $a_{13}$ are the elements in the first row, and $a_{21}$, $a_{22}$, $a_{23}$ are the elements in the second row.

### Matrix Dimensions
The dimensions of a matrix are given by the number of rows and columns. For example, a matrix with $m$ rows and $n$ columns is said to have dimensions $m \times n$.

For instance, in a $3 \times 2$ matrix:

$$
B = \begin{bmatrix}
b_{11} & b_{12} \\  
b_{21} & b_{22} \\
b_{31} & b_{32}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Here, $m = 3$ (number of rows) and $n = 2$ (number of columns).

### Example: Identity Matrix
An important special case is the identity matrix, denoted $I_n$, which is a square matrix with ones on the main diagonal and zeros elsewhere:

$$
I_n = \begin{bmatrix} 
1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
0 & 1 & \cdots & 0 \\  
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
0 & 0 & \cdots & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

For example, the $3 \times 3$ identity matrix is:

$$
I_3 = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0\\ 
0 & 1 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Understanding the definition and notation of matrices is fundamental to working with them effectively. Matrices provide a powerful tool for representing and solving various mathematical and real-world problems.
